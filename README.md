# 🚀 Server Performance Stats

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project is a **bash script** that provides key server performance statistics. It is designed to **analyze system health** by displaying real-time CPU usage, memory utilization, disk usage, and the top processes consuming resources.

## 🎯 Features
- ✅ **CPU Usage** - Displays the total CPU utilization.
- ✅ **Memory Usage** - Shows free vs. used memory with percentage.
- ✅ **Disk Usage** - Reports disk space used and free.
- ✅ **Top 5 CPU-Consuming Processes** - Lists the processes using the most CPU.
- ✅ **Top 5 Memory-Consuming Processes** - Lists the processes using the most memory.
- 💡 **Bonus Stats (Optional)**:
  - OS version
  - System uptime
  - Number of logged-in users
  - Load average
  - Failed login attempts

## 🖥️ Sample Output  
When you run the script, you will see output similar to this:  
```bash
🔍 Server Performance Stats:
----------------------------------
💻 CPU Usage: 25%
🖥️ Memory Usage: 2.5GB / 8GB (31%)
💾 Disk Usage: 50GB / 100GB (50%)
🔥 Top 5 CPU Processes:
1. firefox        12.5%
2. chrome         10.8%
3. systemd        5.3%
4. bash           4.1%
5. docker         3.7%

🔥 Top 5 Memory Processes:
